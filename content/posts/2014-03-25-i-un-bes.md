Amb vint i tants anys de retard, ara m’assabente que no era jo l’únic que ignorava el significat d’aquesta frase, “And a bang on the ear”, que donava títol a una de les meves cançons preferides de [The Waterboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waterboys) en el seu àlbum de 1988 [Fisherman’s Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman%27s_Blues).

📎 [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bang%20on%20the%20ear):

> Of Celtic origin, a phrase meaning an affectionate kiss or pat on the ear or cheek. Popularized by the Scottish band “The Waterboys” in their song of the same name.<br />
> “You to me are treasure, you to me are dear. So I’ll give you my love, and a bang on the ear” - The Waterboys

📎 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman%27s_Blues):

> “And a Bang on the Ear”, in which Scott summarizes a past romantic attachment in each verse, finishing the song with a current “woman of the hearthfire”, was released as the second single from the album […] Confusion amongst listeners about what a bang on the ear might be about prompted The Waterboys’ Frequently Asked Questions page to note, more than ten years later, that it was “a term of affection”. A “bang” means a kiss and this Irish phrase of “bang on the ear” can best be considered equivalent to the more common phrase “peck on the cheek”.
