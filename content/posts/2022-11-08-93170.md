> One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet used to be the annual September influx of clueless newbies who, lacking any sense of netiquette, made a general nuisance of themselvesâ€¦ But in September 1993, AOL users became able to post to Usenet, nearly overwhelming the old-timers' capacity to acculturate them. Syn. eternal September.
